# React Starter Kit

### What's in here?
There are two basic html pages that have React code in them (`hello_world.html` and `like_button.html`)

### Draggable Elements
We will be using the [react_draggable] library to create react webapps with draggable elements. See the demo [here].(It's better to use well-maintained, feature-full, open-source libraries rather than write your own code, wherever possible. Don't re-invent the wheel!)

To install the library, run:
```sh
npm install react-draggable
```
